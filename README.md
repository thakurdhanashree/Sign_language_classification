# Sign_language_classification
Sign language classification refers to the process of recognizing and interpreting signs made using manual gestures, handshapes, and body movements in various sign languages. This task is essential for building systems that can facilitate communication between individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who may not be familiar with sign languages.
